\begin{itemize}
    \item Present the results of the evaluation for different text representations using analogy tests and confusion matrices.
    \item Discuss the findings regarding the effectiveness of each representation model for capturing semantic relationships in technical text.
    \item Analyze the results from the RAG evaluation, highlighting the impact of different representations and text chunk sizes on answer generation quality and CPU efficiency.
    \item Identify the representation model that achieves a balance between factuality of answers and computational demands.
\end{itemize}
