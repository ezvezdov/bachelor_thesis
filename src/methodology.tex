\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the evaluation process for different text representations.
    \item \begin{itemize}
        \item{Specify the chosen word, sentence, and paragraph representation models (e.g., FastText, BERT variants).}
        \item{Explain the usage of analogy tests and confusion matrices for evaluation.}
        \item{Detail the selection process for the UPV corpus set and its suitability for technical QA tasks.}
      \end{itemize}
    \item Outline the second part of the study focusing on RAG for technical QA.
    \item \begin{itemize}
        \item{Explain the RAG algorithm and its reliance on text representations.}
        \item{Describe the evaluation approach for selecting optimal representations for RAG.}
        \item{Mention the factors considered during evaluation, such as embedding efficiency, text chunk size, and factuality of generated answers.}
